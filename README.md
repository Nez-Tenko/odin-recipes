# odin-recipes
In this project I created a a website that links to 3 webpages that each contain a recipe.
The homepage (index.html) has a h1 heading (a 'title' for a page), and 3 links that each go to their respective recipies.

Each recipe page starts with an h1 heading that contains the recipe name, and immediately underneath that h1 element has an img element that has a picture of that particular food item. Then, underneath that image is an h3 heading that has a short "description" of that recipe. Next there is a paragraph element that describes the food. Next there is an h5 tag title Ingredients, and an unordered list that contains all of the ingredients. Then there another h5 tag titled Steps, and an ordered list that contains all of the steps to prepare the recipe. Finally there is another link back to the homepage (idex.html).
